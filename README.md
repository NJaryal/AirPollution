Breathe is a progressive web app(PWA) that provides you with air quality data for many places in an easy to understand interface.

The main goals of creating Breathe were:
- Creating an interface that presents Air quality data in a beautiful manner.
- Making it into a PWA that works very well when offline.

Technologies used:
- Bulma CSS for responsive flex layout structure.
- JSTS Library for extensive Boolean operations.
- Service Workers for PWA.
- Local Forage for using IndexedDB in an easier way.
- Axios for API calls.
- Google Maps Places, Geometry API.
- AQICN API for Air quality data.
